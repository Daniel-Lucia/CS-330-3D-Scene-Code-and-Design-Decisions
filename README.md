# CS 330 3D Scene Code and Design Decisions Description

This repo contains code and a report from my time in the Computational Graphics and Visualization course. This course focused on creating realistic, interactive 3D objects and scenes using C++ and OpenGL libraries. In this course, I develop a  graphical application by working through 3D modeling, lighting, camera movement, and texturing, culminating in a final project that simulates a 3D environment. The 3D environment was a small recreation of a picture I took, showing my kitchen counter with multiple objects on it. I also created code for a light source and camera movement, as well as added appropriate textures for each object in the scene.
